This package provides and manages some fundamental dependencies. It enables easier and more lightweight development of
Java applications that do not use Spring Boot.

## Environment

Through the "Environment" interface, can easily obtain fundamental information about the runtime environment. There is a
default implementation available. You can use it directly or replace it with your custom implementation.

If you are using Spring Boot, please see
the [yorozuya-spring-boot-starter](../yorozuya-spring-boot-starter/README.md).
